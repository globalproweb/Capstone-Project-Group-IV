# Title: Medical Record System DAPP


## Overview


The medical field is one of the largest industries in the world. However, innovation is very limited due to regulations. We decided to target this field due to potential benefits between patients and doctors sharing medical records and protecting patients privacy. We will create a system that will store patient medical records using smart contracts on Ethereum and connect the front end with Streamlit.
