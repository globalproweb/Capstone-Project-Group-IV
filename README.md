# Overview

The medical field is one of the largest industries in the world. However, innovation is very limited due to regulations. We decided to target this field due to potential benefits between patients and doctors sharing medical records and protecting patients privacy. We will show how Blockchain can revolutionize the Medical Records Industry.

We have created a system that will store patient medical records using smart contracts utilizing the Blockchain and connect the front end with Streamlit. We built a decentralized App called the “ Medical Record System”  that will allow patients to tokenize their medical records on the blockchain. This DAPP will help eliminate HIPPA concerns due to the sensitivity of the data.
